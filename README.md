Wordpress to Ghost Converter
============================

This script takes the output from []() and a copy of the ```wp-content``` folder
from a wordpress installation and creates a new folder for images that matches
the Ghost way of doing things and updates image links within the exported posts.

To use: export your data using the _ script and make sure you have file access to
the ```wp-content``` folder from your wordpress install. If your wordpress install
is on a different machine than this script, you should copy the folder to the local
machine.
